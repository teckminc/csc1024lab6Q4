4.	Make a maths quiz that asks five questions by randomly generating
 two whole numbers (1 to 100) to make the question (for example: num1 + num2). 
 Ask the user to enter the answer. If they get it right add a point 
 to their score. At the end of the quiz, tell them how many they 
 got correct out of five. Use only for-loop for the iterative process.

Function to use: random.randint(), int(), input(), print()
Operators: ==, +=
Structure: if, for
Logic: Counter
